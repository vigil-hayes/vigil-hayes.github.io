<meta name="description" content="I am an associate professor of computer science in the School of Informatics, Computing, and Cyber Systems at Northern Arizona University. As a computer scientist, my research revolves around characterizing network trace data and social media data to gain insights into the utilization and adaptation of existing networked systems within underserved communities. Leveraging these insights, I design novel networked systems that better align with the specific needs, values, and usage patterns of these communities, aiming to create more inclusive and human-centric technological solutions. In particular, my work centers the information needs and practices of rural and tribal communities in North America with the goal of addressing longstanding digital and social inequities.
I teach graduate and undergraduate computer science courses related to computer networks and social computing as well as an Honors seminar course that examines the ethical concerns surrounding emergent digital technologies. ">
