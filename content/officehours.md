#### Schedule (Spring 2024)

Office hours take place at HON 108 on Tuesdays from 9-11am. 

I am also happy to schedule a 15 minute ofice hour meeting by appointment if this time does not work for you, but please be aware that my calendar fills up quickly and I will need at least 3-5 days of prior notice to be able to find a time that will work.

#### Meeting material


##### Class Question Meeting
+ If we are meeting to discuss a class assignment or class content, please come prepared by bringing your first attempts at the assignment and some specific questions. Even if you are not sure if you are going in the right direction, an initial attempt is really helpful for me to understand your thinking and we can clarify things much more quickly. 

##### Research Meeting
+ If we are meeting to discuss research, please send me a written description of the work that you would like to discus. 
+ Presentation slides or paper draft are perfectly fine. 
+ If you do not have those, please send a one-page description of the research. 
+ Please send me the material by 8pm on the evening prior of our meeting.
