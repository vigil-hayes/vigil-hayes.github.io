##### Culturally-responsive LLMs for Native American Health Promotion (Google Academic Research Award 2024)

This is a collaboration between myself and colleague Mai ElSherief at Northeastern University. Together, we are working with NAU Campus Health Promotion using focus groups and interviews to understand opportunities, hesitancies, and state of practice associated with using LLMs as part of the workflow to generate health promotion content for Native American audiences.

#### Tools for Community Broadband Advocacy (NSF Award #214586; Rockefeller Foundation)

##### NetGauge Games

*$560K; 10/2022-09/2027*

Using a participatory action research approach, my lab is investigating different mechanisms that encourage more spatially representative mobile broadband measurement. Most recently, we conducted a series of playtesting studies at different sites to understand the impact of NetGauge Games on spatial mobility and coverage as well as using network analysis to quantify how games impact players connection to their environment and other players.

##### CellWatch

*500K; 1/2023-06/2024*

CellWatch is an open-source cellular network measurement suite created by researchers at Georgia Tech, UC Santa Barbara, and Northern Arizona University. I support the design and implementation of a community coordination tool that allows community broadband advocates to work with volunteers to strategically organize measurement campaigns in their region.
