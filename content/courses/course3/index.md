## Overview

This class surveys a range of emergent computational technologies (including AI, the metaverse, and surveillance systems). While students are not expected to arrive with knowledge about computational systems, we will be discussing how these technologies work from a technical perspective in addition to how they operate within the context of society and policy.

Ultimately, the class seeks to answer the following questions:

+ Is it possible for computational technology to be *good*?
+ What is required to design computational technology to maximize the benefits of its impact and minimize the harms?

#### Learning Objectives
By the end of this course, students will be able to:

1. _Compare_ different ethical theories.
2. _Describe_ how some of the most impactful computational technologies work.
3. _Apply_ ethical theories to situations involving people and computational technology.
4. _Write_ a research paper that examines multiple sources to support a thesis statement about the regulations or practices required for a particular technology to be a benefit for society.
5. _Create_ a Twine game that explores different courses of action based on different ethical theories.

## Foundations

In this module, we will focus on establishing a set of shared foundations by definition data, information, knowledge, infrastructure, and computational technology.

We will also develop a shared understanding of basic ethical theories that can be used to examine different technologies as we continue through the course. These include Aristotlean virtue ethics, utilitarianism, and Kant's categorical imperative. We will introduce other ethical theories later in the course, but these will serve as the fundamentals to help us start having meaningful conversations about emergent technologies.

## Expression, Truth, & Responsibility

We will be discussing freedom of expression, moderation, censorship, and misinformation and how technologies such as social media and the Web facilitate and challenge these concepts.

In this module, we will be discussing:

+ *What is OK to say and what is not?*
+ *What is truth?*
+ *When are we obligated to communicate truthfully?*
